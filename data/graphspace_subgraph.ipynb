Currently in my csv files, each row/scholar has multiple columns for teachers and students. There is the original teachers/students column that came from muslimscholars.info, and there are additional teachers/students columns that I made that may have more or less teachers/students for each respective scholar. So with this function I get to choose whether I want to specify which edges between each node and its teachers/students are shown, or whether I just want to keep it as the muslimscholars.info data had it. \n",

So this will makes edges between nodes of the csv if they had any teacher/student relationship, regardless of whether it traces back to the node of interest (e.g.: Aishah) or not. So for example, if I wanted to make a graph just of Aishah and the hadiths she transmitted to her students and the hadiths her students transmitted from HER to their students, this graph would not work - because it would show edges between her teachers/students if they transmitted ANY hadiths to each other, regardless of whether the hadith was transmitted from Aishah or not.\n",

    "    - 'specified_teachers' and 'specified_students' are the names of the columns where I've specified which students/teachers to include for each scholar. For example, if our specified scholar is Aishah r.a., then the graph should have edges from her to all her students (the ones listed in the csv) and from her students to her students' students. It is essentially a subgraph of interrelationships() in that the interrelationships() should include all the edges in onescholar(), but not necessarily the other way around. interrelationships() might show connections between students and students' students whether the hadiths they transmitted to each other were narrated originally from Aishah r.a. or someone else, whereas onescholar() should only show the edges that trace back to Aishah r.a."
